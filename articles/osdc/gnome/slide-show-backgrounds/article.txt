How to create your own wallpaper slide show in GNOME

A very cool (lesser known) feature in GNOME is the ability to create a wallpaper sequence of images.  You can select a wallpaper pack from the background panel in the control center.  You can distinguish the wallpaper pack from static wallpapers from a small clock like emblem on the lower right corner of the preview.

There are some prepackaged wallpaper packs available in most distros, for example Ubuntu includes the stock GNOME timed wallpaper pack as well as a pack of the wallpaper contest winers for the release.

But what if you want to create your own wallpaper pack?  If you aren't afraid to craft some simple XML files in your home directory, you should find it quite simple to create your own.  Fortunately the wallpaper changer honors some common directory paths, which makes it pretty simple to create your own just for your own user session.  You will need to create an XML file in "$HOME/.local/share/gnome-background-properties/SOMENAME.xml".  The file name isn't important, but the directory name matters.  I created /home/ken/.local/share/gnome-background-properties/osdc-wallpapers.xml that looks like this:

<code>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE wallpapers SYSTEM "gnome-wp-list.dtd">
<wallpapers>
 <wallpaper deleted="false">
   <name>opensource.com Wallpapers</name>
   <filename>/home/ken/Pictures/Wallpapers/osdc/osdc.xml</filename>
   <options>zoom</options>
 </wallpaper>
</wallpapers>

</code>

The above XML file needs a wallpaper stanza for each wallpaper pack or static wallpaper you wan to include in the backgrounds panel of the control center.  In this example, osdc.xml file looks like this:

<code>

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<background>
  <static>
    <!-- Duration in seconds to display the background -->
    <duration>30.0</duration>
    <file>/home/ken/Pictures/Wallpapers/osdc/osdc_2.png</file>
  </static>
  <transition>
    <!-- Duration of the transition in seconds, default is 2 seconds -->
    <duration>0.5</duration>
    <from>/home/ken/Pictures/Wallpapers/osdc/osdc_2.png</from>
    <to>/home/ken/Pictures/Wallpapers/osdc/osdc_1.png</to>
  </transition>
  <static>
    <duration>30.0</duration>
    <file>/home/ken/Pictures/Wallpapers/osdc/osdc_1.png</file>
  </static>
  <transition>
    <duration>0.5</duration>
    <from>/home/ken/Pictures/Wallpapers/osdc/osdc_1.png</from>
    <to>/home/ken/Pictures/Wallpapers/osdc/osdc_2.png</to>
  </transition>
</background>

</code>

There's a few important pieces in the above XML.  The background node in the XML is your outer node.  Each background supports multiple "static" and "transition" nodes.  

The "static" node defines an image to be displayed and the duration to display it, with "duration" and "file" nodes respectfully.  

The "transition" node defines the "duration", the "from" image and the "to" image for each transition.  

#HEADING How about time based?

Another cool feature is time based slide shows.  You can define the start time for the slide show and GNOME will calculate the times and transitions based on the start time.  This is useful for changing the wallpaper based on the time of day.  For example you could set the start time to 06:00 and display a wallpaper for the morning until maybe 12:00, change the wallpaper for the afternoon, then again at 18:00.  Different wallpapers for the current time of day.  

This is accomplished by defining the "startime" in your XML like this:

<code>

  <starttime>
    <year>2017</year>
    <month>11</month>
    <day>21</day>
    <hour>6</hour>
    <minute>00</minute>
    <second>00</second>
  </starttime>

</code>

The above XML will start the animation at 06:00 on November 21, 2017.  If you make sure all your durations end up equaling 24 hours to keep it on track for one iteration per day.  You could then set your morning wallpaper duration to 21600.0 (6 hours).  It will then be displayed until 12:00, when your next wallpaper is displayed.  You can continue to do this to change the wallpaper at whatever intervals you'd like throughout the day.  You should ensure when you total the value of all your durations they equal 86400.

Of interest, GNOME will calculate the delta between the start time and the current time and display the correct wallpaper for the current time.  For example, if you select your new wallpaper at 16:00, GNOME will display the proper wallpaper for 36000 seconds past the start time of 06:00.
